<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
    This is a (mostly static) website intended to collect my thoughts and much of my life into one place. This page
    will serve as a quick introduction to the website and details on how I put it together - partially for other people
    but mostly for me in case I want to do it again!
</p>

<h2>Me</h2>
<p>
    My name is Sanchit Sharma, sometimes also referred to as:
    <ul>
        <li>San
        <li>Sam
        <li>TTIO or TTIOttio (each letter pronounced separately)
        <li>PuppyKit (hence the url)
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    I'm a software developer, devops person and all-round nerdy person. Head on over to my <a href="personal.html">
    personal page</a> for more info.
</p>

<h2>The Site</h2>
<p>
    This website is running off a microserver sitting next to my desk. I've done everything from scratch - from hosting
    to the domain to writing the code myself, by hand. Mostly this has been a learning exercise - I'm not sure I would
    do things the same way in the future - but I do enjoy the idea that I'm able to host things from my own home!
</p>
<p>
    So how does it work? The code is hosted <a href="https://github.com/Sandvich/puppykit">on github</a> so feel free
    to browse at your leisure. The code is licensed under the Apache-2.0 license, so copy, reuse, mess around with
    whatever you feel like. If you have suggestions, feel free to open pull requests or issues.
</p>

<h2>The Server</h2>
<p>
    I own a <a href="https://www.hpe.com/uk/en/product-catalog/servers/proliant-servers/pip.hpe-proliant-microserver-gen8.5379860.html">
    HPE ProLiant MicroServer Gen8</a> which currently lives next to my desk. Aside from being a small and low-powered
    device, it's easily quiet enough to sit in my bedroom, which is a massive plus. Inside is currently a single 2TB
    spinning-platter drive, though I plan to increase that to a second for RAID and then potentially two more for
    increased storage.
</p>
<p>
    The server itself is running Fedora Server 25, and I run updates daily with an ansible playbook that manages all of
    my hardware. Whenever a new kernel is pushed to the repositories, I immediately install it and reboot into the new
    kernel.
</p>
<p>
    Since this site is currently running on the single server (no HA yet!), this results in relatively high downtime.
    For me, this is a satisfactory tradeoff as the site has little traffic at the moment. However, I've also covered
    the details of how to install and run Openshift in HA mode - multiple masters, multiple nodes, and multiple etcd
    nodes.
</p>
<p>
    The OS has the minimum installed: Openshift, Ansible and a few other utilities aside from the basic install of
    Fedora Server.
</p>

<h2>Openshift</h2>
<p>
    All my code runs in Openshift. This means everything hosted on this server. I do this for security and also a
    little bit for convenience. My main project (which contains this site) has a route set up inside of Openshift that
    forwards traffic to the primary container.
</p>
<p>
    That container is a simple Docker container based on the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd/">HTTPD image</a>
    with my website and a slightly edited conf file inside (see
    <a href="https://github.com/Sandvich/puppykit/blob/master/Dockerfile">the Dockerfile</a>).
</p>
<img src="img/server.jpg" alt="Server + Openshift">
<p class="caption">My server on the left, the Openshift web client on the right.</p>

<p>
    Technically, Openshift is overkill for what I'm trying to do here. However, I've taken this on as a learning
    exercise and I expect that Openshift will be useful for some of the things that I want to host here in the future,
    so I've stuck with it.
</p>
<p>
    To make my life a bit simpler, the hosts file on my dev machine allows me to directly access my server, so I can
    see how things differ when accessing it internally vs from the outside world.
</p>
<p>
    Since I don't want to allow ports other than 80 and 443 through my router, I haven't set up build hooks. This means
    that I have to manually build the site container when I update it, but I think this is a fair compromise as once
    the site is fully built it won't be updated more than once every month or so.
</p>

<h2>Gandi</h2>
<p>
    My registrar is <a href="www.gandi.net">Gandi</a>, although it annoys me that they spelled Gandhi wrong :p
</p>
<p>
    They've been pretty easy to work with and have a good corporate philosophy in my opinion. Although my mail is not
    currently running, I plan to use their services for it as I'm not interested in setting up a mail server from
    scratch just yet.
