<h1>Info about my projects</h1>
<p>
    Below is information about a number of projects that I've worked on.
</p>

<h2>Gaming</h2>
<h3><a href="https://longestegg.itch.io/ghost">Ghost</a></h3>
<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/62584?dark=true" width="552" height="167"></iframe>
<p><a href="https://github.com/avivbeeri/GameJam">Source code</a></p>
<p>
    We'd like to keep working on this, but for now the LowRezJam release is where we're leaving it. We may pick it up
    again one day.
</p>

<h3><a href="https://ttio.itch.io/physsim">PhysSim</a></h3>
<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/105887?dark=true" width="552" height="167"></iframe>
<p>
    This was a project to help me learn how to use the Godot engine. I'm not going to be adding any more to this.
</p>

<h3>Unnamed Ship Game:</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Sandvich/ship-scroller">Source Code</a></p>
<p>
    My current active coding project (aside from this website). This is hopefully going to be a lot bigger than the
    other two video game projects I worked on. I have a detailed plan for it, but can't work on it as much as I would
    like due to time constraints. No Itch.IO page yet, but watch this space!
</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.shadesofvengeance.com/markedfordeath/">Marked For Death</a></h3>
<img src="img/mfd_police.png" alt="Here come the police!">
<p style="margin-top:1em;">
    A Fate module written by myself and published by Shades of Vengeance. There was more I was planning to do with this,
    but I don't like the system anymore. I think I made it too complex. I'm quite proud of the campaign and universe I
    wrote though, so if you're interested, check it out!
</p>
<img src="img/mfd_zhu.png" alt="Zhu, a major NPC">
<p class="caption">Zhu is one of the major antagonists in the campaign I wrote - you can probably see why!</p>
<p style="margin-top:1em;">
    You can download the character sheets <a href="files/CharSheet.pdf">here</a>, a short campaign that I wrote for the
    game <a href="files/Campaign.pdf">here</a> and buy the game from <a href="http://www.shadesofvengeance.com/markedfordeath/">Shades of Vengeance</a>,
    <a href="http://drivethrurpg.com/product/155856/Marked-For-Death">DriveThruRPG</a> or myself (in person). The latter
    is the only way to get a print copy!
</p>

<h3>Unnamed Board Game</h3>
<p>
    <em>Note: This is in the very early stages of planning.</em><br>I am developing a board game about cracking -
    set in a cyberpunk universe the players assemble attack programs to steal valuables from their targets. Unlike most
    games of this style, the players have no ability to control the programs once they unleash them - cyberspace is too
    fast for humans to respond in the way that people do in most cyberpunk settings!
</p>
<p>
    For extra nerd cred, I plan to write the rulebook in C++/Markdown.
</p>

<h2>Coding</h2>
<h3>PuppyKit</h3>
<p>
    This website! See <a href="index.html">my homepage</a> for more details.
</p>

<h3>Runner's Hub</h3>
<p>
    A small website to help maintain a Shadowrun runner's hub. This will go live on runners.puppykit.org.uk in the future.
</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/Sandvich/MysticEmpyrean">Empyrean Traits</a></h3>
<p>
    A small tool to help players of the game Mystic Empyrean look up traits. This may eventually change into a QT/C++
    program to increase portability, and if I ever learn Android programming I'll be making an app for it too. For now
    though, what you see is what you get.
