#Puppykit
A repo for my website, [www.puppykit.org.uk](www.puppykit.org.uk)

Static, mostly a portfolio. Written almost entirely from scratch, using a small amount of JQuery and Pure CSS to make my
life a little easier.<br>
The CSS and HTML for the navbar are from Pure's example [navbar](https://purecss.io/layouts/tucked-menu-vertical/).
