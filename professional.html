<h1>My Professional Life</h1>
<p>
    I am a software developer (fluent in Python, C++ and Java, but definitely a polyglot) and devops engineer. On this
    page you will be able to see my credentials and find out a bit more about my abilities. I've split it up into:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Education
    <li>Employment
    <li>Other details
</ul>
<p>
    Note: This page is still incomplete. I plan to put a lot more detail into each section, but for now I've only put
    in the basics.
</p>

<p style="padding-top:1em">
    In September 2015 I did a 3-day course with <a href="https://www.theknowledgeacademy.com/">The Knowledge Academy</a>
    covering Scrum and Scrum Mastering. I passed the course and as a result am now a Certified Scrum Master.
</p>
<p>
    From 2011 to 2015 I studied Geophysics at the Royal School of Mines, <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial
    College London</a>, taking a year out for my health in the middle. I experienced a great deal during my time at
    Imperial and learned even more. I graduated with a 2:2 in the end, but I feel that this was in part due to the
    relative emphasis on geology in my course. I consistently did well in the maths, physics and computing modules and
    it was the others that caused me to struggle.<br>
    Imperial College is where I picked up my love of board games and where I learned a lot of organisational skills,
    helping to run two student societies during my time there.
</p>
<p>
    Before Imperial College, I did my A-levels at the <a href="http://www.ktemplar.herts.sch.uk/">Knights Templar
    School</a> in Baldock, Hertfordshire.
</p>

<h2>Employment</h2>
<p>
    Although my post-graduation professional life has been short, I spent a lot of time working on short contracts
    when I was at school. The details are below (in reverse order):
</p>

<h3>Vocal Planet Ltd, February 2016-May 2017, Junior Developer:</h3>
<p>
    I worked as part of a small scrum team in Vocal Planet, primarily focusing on the infrastructure and database
    requirements of the team. The key things I learned were the software development lifecycle, test driven development
    and continuous integration. I helped to develop a master data management solution which has yet to enter the
    market, and made extensive use of JDBC, SQLAlchemy, Django and Flask.
</p>

<h3>Imperial College London, Summer 2013, Placement at the Applied Modelling and Computation Group (AMCG):</h3>
<p>
    During this placement I learned about fluid dynamics and computational modelling.<br>
    I worked alongside computational physicists in the department and delivered a tool to convert templates from the
    Ecolab software package to their open source Fluidity program.<br>
    The project was done within a Ubuntu Linux environment, and written in Python with the Pyparsing module.
</p>

<h3>Xerox Ltd, Summer 2011, Assistant Scrum Master:</h3>
<p>
    I worked alongside some of their scrum teams, helping to manage the teams and also to develop tools to measure
    their metrics and performance. This was primarily done in Python and HTML5.
</p>

<h3>Maplin Electronics, November 2009-April 2011, Part Time Sales Advisor</h3>
<p>
    I expanded my knowledge of  electronics and computing and proved my problem solving skills. I developed good people
    skills while working at Maplin.
</p>

<h3>Xerox Ltd, Summer 2009, Placement</h3>
<p>
    I worked on a commercially sensitive printer technology which has not yet entered the market.<br>
    I learned research skills, communication skills and some programming. Despite coming across new mathematical
    concepts as part of this, I completed the project to a high standard.<br>
    As a result, a patent application was submitted for my work.
</p>

<h3>EADS Astrium, Summer 2008, Work Experience Placement</h3>
<p>
    I worked in the satellite department to analyse a specific project path for the department to pursue. I had to
    collect large amounts of information about current projects similar to the one they were considering. In order to
    understand all the information that was available, I discussed the problem with my colleagues and learned from them
    to improve my own understanding.<br>
    I effectively researched and presented this to my manager.
</p>

<h2>Other Details</h2>
<h3>Computing Experience</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I use Scrum in my own projects on various scales, and am a certified Scrum Master.
    <li>I built my own PC at the age of 13.
    <li>I am fluent in bash/ansible and have experience setting up and running servers.
    <li>I use Linux extensively and am extremely confident with it.
    <li>I am fluent in Python, Java and C++

    <li>Writing code clearly and documenting it properly are things I do automatically.
    <li>I understand and embrace Scrum and Agile programming methods.
    <li>I have experience developing APIs.
    <li>I have experience using various public APIs including SteamSpy and TfL, working with both JSON and XML.
    <li>I primarily work on backends, but am able to integrate into frontends and have build a few of my own using
    QT/C++, JavaFX/Java, PyGame/Python and Tkinter/Python.
    <li>I have skill in data processing, including the use of filters to improve the signal to noise ratio in
    real-life data and large scale simulation.
    <li>I have analysed large volumes of data – sorting and bucketing data appropriately, using tools to remove
    outliers.
</ul>
